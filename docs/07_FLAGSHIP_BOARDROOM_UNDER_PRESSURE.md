# Flagship Simulation: Boardroom Under Pressure

## Overview

**Boardroom Under Pressure** is Simvado's first simulation product — a cinematic, interactive experience designed for corporate boards and executive leadership teams.

**Target audience:** Corporate board members, C-suite executives, governance professionals
**Format:** Video-driven cinematic simulation (not 3D-rendered)
**Aspect ratio:** 16:9 immersive, optimized for tablet and desktop
**Duration:** 45–90 minutes per module

## Format Decision: Video-Based Cinematic

The flagship uses **pre-produced video scenes with branching narrative**, not real-time 3D rendering.

**Rationale:**
- Cinematic video feels premium and credible for executive audiences
- Lower technical complexity than real-time 3D for Phase 1
- Allows professional actors, real sets, and high production value
- Branching is handled at the scene level (choose path → play corresponding video)
- AI layer handles NPC dialogue responses and adaptive debrief, not visual rendering

**Technical implication:** The simulation player is a **branching video player with decision overlays**, not a 3D engine. Three.js is not needed for Phase 1.

## Core Modules (7 Scenarios)

Each module is a standalone scenario that can be played independently or as a full series.
