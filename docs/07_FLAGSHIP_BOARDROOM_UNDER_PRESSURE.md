# Flagship Simulation: Boardroom Under Pressure

## Overview

**Boardroom Under Pressure** is Simvado's first simulation product — an immersive, high-fidelity experience designed for corporate boards and executive leadership teams.

**Target audience:** Corporate board members, C-suite executives, governance professionals
**Game Engine:** Unreal Engine
**Format:** 3D cinematic simulation with interactive decision-making
**Duration:** 45–90 minutes per module

## Format Decision: Unreal Engine 3D

The flagship uses **Unreal Engine** for a fully immersive 3D experience.

**Rationale:**
- Unreal Engine delivers cinematic quality that feels premium and credible for executive audiences
- High-fidelity 3D environments create immersion impossible with web-based formats
- Professional character animation and voice acting add realism
- Unreal's tooling supports complex branching narratives and real-time interactions
- Game engine handles all rendering, gameplay, and decision logic locally
- Platform integration via API — game reports events, decisions, and scores to Simvado

**Technical implication:** The simulation runs as a standalone Unreal Engine application. It connects to the Simvado platform via the Game Engine API to create sessions, report events, and submit final scores. The platform handles analytics, AI debriefs, and user management.

## Core Modules (7 Scenarios)

Each module is a standalone scenario that can be played independently or as a full series.

| # | Module | Scenario | Core Dilemma |
|---|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Activist Investor Showdown** | Aggressive investor demands board seats | Defend strategy vs. negotiate vs. capitulate |
| 2 | **Insider Warning** | Anonymous whistleblower alleges fraud by CEO | Investigate quietly vs. escalate vs. suppress |
| 3 | **Crisis Communication Under Fire** | Product failure causes public harm | Transparent response vs. controlled narrative vs. legal shield |
| 4 | **ESG Backlash** | Environmental scandal threatens brand | Divest operations vs. PR campaign vs. double down |
| 5 | **CEO Succession Crisis** | CEO exits unexpectedly, two internal candidates | Internal promotion vs. external search vs. interim leader |
| 6 | **Cybersecurity Breach** | Major data breach with ransom demand | Pay ransom vs. refuse + disclose vs. contain quietly |
| 7 | **Regulatory Investigation** | Government probe into financial practices | Cooperate fully vs. legal resistance vs. settlement |

| Risk Management | Identifying, assessing, and mitigating threats |
| Ethical Judgment | Balancing stakeholder interests against principles |

| Strategic Decision Making | Long-term thinking under short-term pressure |

## Simulation Flow (Per Module)

```
1. BRIEFING (In-Engine)
   3D scene: Setting with context, stakes, and key characters
   Duration: 3–5 minutes

2. STAKEHOLDER INTRODUCTION (In-Engine)
   Interactive: Meet key NPCs in the boardroom environment
   Player reviews documents, emails, reports (in-engine UI)

3. DECISION POINT 1 (In-Engine → Reports to Platform)
   Choice overlay: 3–4 options presented
   Timer: Optional pressure timer (60–120 seconds)
   Each choice triggers different scene branch
   → Game engine POSTs decision event to Simvado API

4. CONSEQUENCE & REACTION (In-Engine)
   3D scene: NPCs react to your decision
   Dynamic dialogue and character behavior based on player history

5. DECISION POINT 2–4 (In-Engine → Reports to Platform)
   Subsequent rounds with escalating complexity
   Choices compound — earlier decisions affect available options
   → Each decision reported as event to Simvado API

6. RESOLUTION (In-Engine → Completion to Platform)
   3D scene: Outcome based on cumulative decisions
   Multiple possible endings per module
   → Game engine POSTs completion + final scores to Simvado API

7. SCORECARD (Platform)
   Multi-axis score visualization on Simvado dashboard
   Comparison to peer average (anonymized)

8. AI DEBRIEF (Platform)
   Personalized analysis generated by Claude
   What you did well, what you missed, alternative paths
   Accessible on Simvado web dashboard
```

## Game Engine → Platform Integration

The Unreal Engine build integrates with Simvado using the Game Engine API:

| Event | API Call | When |
|-------|----------|------|
| Session start | `POST /api/game/sessions` | Player launches simulation |
| Decision made | `POST /api/game/sessions/:id/events` | After each decision point |
| Milestone reached | `POST /api/game/sessions/:id/events` | Key narrative moments |
| Score update | `POST /api/game/sessions/:id/events` | After score recalculation |
| Session complete | `POST /api/game/sessions/:id/complete` | End of module |

## MVP Scope (Phase 1 Launch)
