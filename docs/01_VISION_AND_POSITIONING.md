# Vision & Positioning

## What is Simvado?

Simvado is a **decision-intelligence simulation platform** for professional training.

It allows professionals across industries to:
- Practice high-stakes decision-making in realistic scenarios
- Navigate ethical dilemmas with measurable consequences
- Manage crises under time pressure
- Experience leadership situations they can't safely rehearse in real life

## Core Thesis

Traditional professional training is passive — slides, PDFs, and lectures.

Simvado is active. People don't learn leadership from content. They learn from **decisions under pressure**.

The gap between knowing what to do and doing it under stress is where Simvado lives.

## Competitive Positioning
