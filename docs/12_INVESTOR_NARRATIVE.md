# Investor Narrative

## The Problem

The world trains its most important decision-makers with the least effective methods.

Corporate boards govern trillions in assets. Hospital leaders make life-and-death calls. Government officials shape policy for millions. Yet they all train the same way: **slides, PDFs, and workshops.**

There is no flight simulator for leadership. No safe space to practice a boardroom crisis, a regulatory investigation, or an ethical dilemma — until the real one happens.

The cost of unprepared leaders is measured in billions: corporate scandals, governance failures, reputational collapses, and preventable crises.

## The Solution

**Simvado is Decision-Intelligence Training.**

We build cinematic, AI-powered simulations where professionals practice high-stakes decisions in realistic scenarios — and receive measurable, personalized feedback.

Think of it as: **the flight simulator for professional leadership.**

### How It Works

1. Player enters an immersive scenario (e.g., boardroom crisis with an activist investor)
2. Makes decisions under pressure with real consequences in the simulation
3. AI-powered NPCs react dynamically — no two sessions are identical
4. Multi-dimensional scorecard measures governance, ethics, risk management, and strategy
5. AI-generated debrief provides personalized coaching on what they did well and what they missed

## The Market

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**

| Segment | Market Size |
|---------|------------|
| Corporate training | $370B globally |
| Executive education | $70B globally |
| Simulation-based training (defense, aviation, healthcare) | $20B globally |

Simvado targets the intersection: **simulation-based professional training for knowledge workers** — a category that barely exists today.

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):**
- Enterprise leadership development: $15B
- Board governance training: $2B
- Professional simulation platforms: <$500M (nascent)

## The Business Model

| Revenue Stream | Phase | Size |
|---------------|-------|------|
| Enterprise licensing | Phase 1–2 | $25K–$100K+ per org/year |
| Individual subscriptions | Phase 1 | $79/month or $699/year |
| Custom simulation development | Phase 2 | $100K–$500K per project |
| Marketplace revenue share | Phase 3 | 50% of creator revenue |

**Path to $1M ARR:** 15 enterprise customers at $50K average + 200 individual subscribers.

## Why Now

1. **AI maturity** — Large language models (Claude, GPT) now generate realistic dialogue and personalized coaching at production quality
2. **Remote work** — distributed teams need scalable, digital training that works without flying people to workshops
3. **Governance scrutiny** — post-2020 corporate scandals have increased regulatory and shareholder pressure on board preparedness
4. **Simulation precedent** — aviation, military, and healthcare have proven simulation training works; professional services are next

## Competitive Advantage

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Platform, not project** | Competitors build one-off custom simulations. Simvado is a reusable engine + content library. |
| **AI-native** | AI isn't bolted on — it powers dialogue, adaptation, and debriefs at the core. |
| **Cinematic quality** | Executive audiences expect premium. We deliver boardroom-grade production value. |
| **Measurable outcomes** | 5-axis scoring and AI debriefs give L&D teams the ROI metrics they need. |
| **Marketplace moat** | Phase 3 marketplace creates network effects — more studios = more content = more users. |
