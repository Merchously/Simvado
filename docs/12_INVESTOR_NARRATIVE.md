# Investor Narrative

## The Problem

The world trains its most important decision-makers with the least effective methods.

Corporate boards govern trillions in assets. Hospital leaders make life-and-death calls. Government officials shape policy for millions. Yet they all train the same way: **slides, PDFs, and workshops.**

There is no flight simulator for leadership. No safe space to practice a boardroom crisis, a regulatory investigation, or an ethical dilemma — until the real one happens.

The cost of unprepared leaders is measured in billions: corporate scandals, governance failures, reputational collapses, and preventable crises.

## The Solution

**Simvado is Decision-Intelligence Training.**

We build a platform where professionals discover, launch, and review immersive simulations built in industry-leading game engines (Unreal Engine, Unity) — and receive measurable, AI-powered feedback.

Think of it as: **the Netflix of professional training simulations.**

### How It Works

1. Professional browses the Simvado simulation library and selects a scenario
2. Launches an immersive simulation built in Unreal Engine (or Unity)
3. Makes decisions under pressure with real consequences in the simulation
4. Game engine reports gameplay data back to the Simvado platform
5. Multi-dimensional scorecard measures governance, ethics, risk management, and strategy
6. AI-generated debrief provides personalized coaching on what they did well and what they missed

## The Market

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**

| Segment | Market Size |
|---------|------------|
| Corporate training | $370B globally |
| Executive education | $70B globally |
| Simulation-based training (defense, aviation, healthcare) | $20B globally |

Simvado targets the intersection: **simulation-based professional training for knowledge workers** — a category that barely exists today.

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):**
- Enterprise leadership development: $15B
- Board governance training: $2B
- Professional simulation platforms: <$500M (nascent)

## The Business Model

| Revenue Stream | Phase | Size |
|---------------|-------|------|
| Enterprise licensing | Phase 1–2 | $25K–$100K+ per org/year |
| Individual subscriptions | Phase 1 | $79/month or $699/year |
| Custom simulation development | Phase 2 | $100K–$500K per project |
| Marketplace revenue share | Phase 3 | 50% of creator revenue |

**Path to $1M ARR:** 15 enterprise customers at $50K average + 200 individual subscribers.

## Why Now

1. **AI maturity** — Large language models (Claude, GPT) now generate production-quality coaching and personalized debriefs
2. **Game engine accessibility** — Unreal Engine and Unity enable cinematic-quality simulations at lower cost than ever
3. **Remote work** — distributed teams need scalable, digital training that works without flying people to workshops
4. **Governance scrutiny** — post-2020 corporate scandals have increased regulatory and shareholder pressure on board preparedness
5. **Simulation precedent** — aviation, military, and healthcare have proven simulation training works; professional services are next

## Competitive Advantage

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Platform, not project** | Competitors build one-off custom simulations. Simvado is a platform with a growing simulation library. |
| **AI-native debriefs** | AI isn't bolted on — it powers personalized coaching and analytics at the core. |
| **Game engine quality** | Simulations built in Unreal/Unity deliver executive-grade immersion. |
| **Measurable outcomes** | Multi-axis scoring and AI debriefs give L&D teams the ROI metrics they need. |
| **Marketplace moat** | Phase 3 marketplace creates network effects — more studios = more simulations = more users. |

## The Ask

Simvado is raising a **pre-seed round** to:
1. Complete Phase 1 platform development
2. Build flagship simulation in Unreal Engine (7 modules)
3. Onboard 3–5 enterprise pilot customers
4. Hire: 1 game developer, 1 3D artist

**Use of funds:**
| Category | Allocation |
|----------|-----------|
| Product development | 40% |
| Simulation production (Unreal) | 30% |
| Sales & marketing | 20% |
| Operations | 10% |

## Simvado = Platform + Studio + Marketplace

```
Phase 1: We build the platform + flagship simulation (Unreal Engine) and prove it works
Phase 2: We scale with enterprise customers and expand the library
Phase 3: We open the platform to external studios (any game engine)
Phase 4: We become the global standard for simulation-based professional training
```
