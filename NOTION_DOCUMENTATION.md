## 1. Overview

### What is Simvado?

Simvado is a **Decision-Intelligence Simulation Platform** for professional training — the **Netflix of Training Simulations**. It is a platform and directory where professionals discover, launch, and review immersive simulations built in industry-leading game engines (Unreal Engine, Unity, etc.).

**What the platform does:**
- **Catalog & Discovery** — browse simulations by industry, skill, difficulty
- **Authentication & Subscriptions** — user management, tier enforcement
- **Analytics & Dashboards** — multi-axis scoring, peer comparison, progress tracking
- **AI-Powered Debriefs** — personalized coaching analysis generated by Claude
- **Enterprise Management** — seat management, assignments, team analytics, SSO

**What the platform does NOT do:**
- Does NOT render or run simulations — that's the game engine's job
- Does NOT contain a web-based simulation player — simulations run externally

**Core thesis:** Traditional professional training is passive — slides, PDFs, lectures. People don't learn leadership from content. They learn from *decisions under pressure*. Simvado fills that gap by connecting immersive game-engine simulations to a platform that provides measurable, personalized feedback.

### Flagship Product

**Boardroom Under Pressure** — an immersive 3D simulation for corporate boards and executive leadership teams, built in **Unreal Engine** and distributed through the Simvado platform. 7 modules covering activist investors, whistleblowers, crisis communications, ESG backlash, CEO succession, cybersecurity breaches, and regulatory investigations.

## 2. Vision & Phases

All documentation follows these canonical phase definitions:

| Phase | Name | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Phase 1** | Foundation | Launch Boardroom Under Pressure (Unreal Engine). Individual + pilot enterprise access. Internal studio only. |
| **Phase 2** | Enterprise Scale | Enterprise dashboard, seat management, analytics. Add 3 more executive simulations. |
| **Phase 3** | Marketplace | Open platform to third-party simulation studios. Revenue-share model. |
| **Phase 4** | Global Expansion | Multi-language, multi-industry. Full simulation library across verticals. |

### Long-Term Vision

```
Phase 1: We build the platform + flagship simulation (Unreal Engine) and prove it works
Phase 2: We scale with enterprise customers and expand the library
Phase 3: We open the platform to external studios (any game engine)
Phase 4: We become the global standard for simulation-based professional training
```

### Competitive Positioning

| Category | Existing Solutions | Simvado Difference |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Corporate training | LMS platforms (Cornerstone, SAP Litmos) | Immersive game-engine simulations vs. passive video/quiz |
| Leadership development | Workshops, coaching | Scalable, repeatable, measurable |
| Serious games | Custom-built one-offs | Platform with simulation library + game engine integration API |
| Business simulations | Academic case studies (Harvard) | Real-time immersive scenarios in professional game engines |

**Competitive advantages:** Platform not project, AI-native debriefs, cinematic game-engine quality, measurable outcomes (multi-axis scoring), marketplace moat in Phase 3.

| Simulation catalog & discovery | Platform (Simvado) |
| Simulation gameplay & rendering | Game Engine (Unreal/Unity) |
| Decision logic & branching | Game Engine |
| Score calculation | Hybrid (engine calculates, platform stores/verifies) |
| Event reporting | Game Engine → Platform API |
| Session management | Hybrid (platform creates, engine tracks gameplay state) |
| Analytics & dashboards | Platform (Simvado) |
| AI debriefs | Platform (Simvado) |
| Enterprise management | Platform (Simvado) |
| Payments & subscriptions | Platform (Simvado) |

2. **Stakeholder Introduction** (In-Engine) — Meet NPCs, review documents
3. **Decision Point 1** (In-Engine → API) — 3-4 options, optional timer → event reported to Simvado
4. **Consequence & Reaction** (In-Engine) — NPC reactions, dynamic dialogue
5. **Decision Points 2-4** (In-Engine → API) — Escalating complexity, events reported
6. **Resolution** (In-Engine → API) — Outcome scene, completion + final scores reported
7. **Scorecard** (Platform) — Multi-axis score visualization on Simvado dashboard
8. **AI Debrief** (Platform) — Personalized analysis by Claude, accessible on web

### Game Engine → Platform Integration

| Event | API Call | When |
|-------|----------|------|
| Session start | `POST /api/game/sessions` | Player launches simulation |
| Decision made | `POST /api/game/sessions/:id/events` | After each decision point |
| Milestone reached | `POST /api/game/sessions/:id/events` | Key narrative moments |
| Score update | `POST /api/game/sessions/:id/events` | After score recalculation |
| Session complete | `POST /api/game/sessions/:id/complete` | End of module |

### MVP Scope

---

## 5. Scoring System

### Configurable Scoring Dimensions

Default 5-axis scoring for Boardroom Under Pressure:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Financial Impact** | Economic consequences of decisions |
| **Reputational Risk** | Public perception and brand damage |
| **Ethical Integrity** | Alignment with moral and legal standards |
| **Stakeholder Confidence** | Trust from board, employees, investors, public |
| **Long-term Stability** | Sustainability of decisions over time |

### Scoring Formula

```
total_score = Sum(dimension_score x dimension_weight)
```
- Dimension scores: 0-100 (calculated by game engine per decision)
- Dimension weights: 0.0-1.0 (must sum to 1.0, configurable per simulation)
- Game engine calculates and reports scores; platform stores, displays, and can verify

### Grade Scale

| Score | Grade |
|-------|-------|
| 90-100 | A+ |
| 85-89 | A |
| 80-84 | A- |
| 75-79 | B+ |
| 70-74 | B |
| 65-69 | B- |
| 60-64 | C+ |
| 55-59 | C |
| 50-54 | C- |
| < 50 | D |

### Event Reporting During Gameplay

The game engine reports events to the platform via the Game Engine API:

| Event Type | When | Data Reported |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| `decision` | Player makes a choice | Choice details, options available, time spent |
| `milestone` | Key narrative moment reached | Milestone identifier, context |
| `score_update` | After score recalculation | Current scores per dimension |
| `completion` | End of module | Final scores, total duration |

---

## 6. AI System

Simvado uses AI on the **platform side** for post-session analysis and coaching. Gameplay logic, scoring, and decision branching are handled by the game engine — no LLM in the gameplay loop.

### Architecture Principle

AI handles generative tasks on the platform (debriefs, coaching reports). Deterministic tasks (scoring, branching, state) are handled by the game engine using structured logic.

```
GAME ENGINE (Runtime — Not Simvado)
├── Decision logic, branching, NPC behavior
├── Score calculation (deterministic)
├── Dynamic dialogue and adaptation
└── Event reporting → Simvado Game Engine API

SIMVADO PLATFORM (Post-Session)
├── Debrief Generator → Personalized coaching analysis
└── Enterprise Analytics → Org-level reports and insights
```

### Platform AI Features

| Feature | AI Model | When | Latency Target |
|---------|----------|------|----------------|
| Debrief Generator | Claude Sonnet | After session completion | < 10 seconds |
| Enterprise Analytics | Claude | On-demand (reports) | < 30 seconds |

### Debrief Structure

1. Summary of Decisions — What path you took and key choice moments
2. Strengths — What you handled well (tied to scoring dimensions)
3. Blind Spots — What you missed or underweighted
4. Alternative Paths — What would have happened if you chose differently
5. Development Recommendations — Specific skills to develop based on scoring patterns

### What the Game Engine Handles (Not Platform AI)

| Capability | Owner |
|-----------|-------|
| NPC dialogue | Game Engine |
| Decision branching | Game Engine |
| Score calculation | Game Engine |
| Adaptive difficulty | Game Engine |
| Visual rendering | Game Engine |

### Authoring-Time AI (Content Creation)

During simulation production (not runtime), AI assists the Simvado Studio team with scenario generation, decision tree review, and scoring calibration. These tools do not run during gameplay or on the platform at runtime.

### Prompt Management

AI prompts are stored as versioned templates including system instruction, context injection points, output format specification, and token budget.

## 15. Content Studio Model

### Phase 1: Internal Production Pipeline (10 Steps)

1. Research & Brief
2. Narrative Design → Game design document
3. Game Design & Decision Architecture
4. Stakeholder & Character Design → 3D assets
5. Scoring Rubric Design → JSON (stored on platform)
6. Game Engine Development → Unreal Engine build
7. Platform Integration → Connect via Game Engine API
8. AI Debrief Engineering → Prompt templates

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Simulation Designer | Narrative, decision architecture, scoring logic |
| Game Developer | Unreal/Unity development, 3D environments, gameplay |
| AI Engineer | Debrief prompts, coaching logic, platform AI |
| 3D Artist | Character models, environments, visual assets |
| Audio Designer | Voice acting, ambient sound, music |
| QA Tester | End-to-end simulation + API integration testing |
| Product Lead | Prioritization, review, publish approval |

### Phase 3: External Studio Model

Studios get: Game Engine API & SDKs (Unreal, Unity), platform integration guide, marketplace distribution, analytics, AI debriefs, automated payments (50/50 via Stripe Connect).

### Quality Standards for External Studios

- All simulations must integrate with the Game Engine API (sessions, events, completion)
- Scoring data must map to the platform's configurable scoring dimensions
- Content must meet Simvado editorial guidelines
- Simulations must pass API integration testing and event schema validation

### Simvado's Role Evolves

```
Phase 1: Studio (we build simulations in Unreal + run the platform)
Phase 2: Studio + Platform (we build more simulations, expand platform features)
Phase 3: Platform + Marketplace (we run the platform, studios build simulations too)
Phase 4: Global Distribution Engine (platform at scale across industries and engines)
```

## 17. Investor Narrative

### The Problem

The world trains its most important decision-makers with the least effective methods. Corporate boards govern trillions in assets using slides and workshops. There is no flight simulator for leadership.

### The Solution

**Simvado is Decision-Intelligence Training.** A platform where professionals discover, launch, and review immersive simulations built in industry-leading game engines (Unreal Engine, Unity) — and receive measurable, AI-powered feedback. Think of it as the Netflix of professional training simulations.

### How It Works

1. Professional browses the Simvado simulation library and selects a scenario
2. Launches an immersive simulation built in Unreal Engine (or Unity)
3. Makes decisions under pressure with real consequences in the simulation
4. Game engine reports gameplay data back to the Simvado platform
5. Multi-dimensional scorecard measures governance, ethics, risk management, and strategy
6. AI-generated debrief provides personalized coaching

### The Market

| Segment | Market Size |
|---------|------------|
| Corporate training (TAM) | $370B globally |
| Executive education | $70B globally |
| Simulation-based training | $20B globally |
| Enterprise leadership dev (SAM) | $15B |
| Board governance training | $2B |

### Why Now

1. **AI maturity** — Claude generates production-quality coaching and debriefs
2. **Game engine accessibility** — Unreal/Unity enable cinematic quality at lower cost
3. **Remote work** — distributed teams need scalable digital training
4. **Governance scrutiny** — post-2020 scandals increased pressure on board preparedness
5. **Simulation precedent** — aviation/military/healthcare proved simulation works

### The Ask

Pre-seed round to:
1. Complete Phase 1 platform development
2. Build flagship simulation in Unreal Engine (7 modules)
3. Onboard 3-5 enterprise pilots
4. Hire: 1 game developer, 1 3D artist

| Category | Allocation |
|----------|-----------|
| Product development | 40% |
| Simulation production (Unreal) | 30% |
| Sales & marketing | 20% |
| Operations | 10% |

## 18. Current Build Status

### What's Built (M1.1 + M1.2 Complete)

- Full Next.js 15 application scaffold
- Marketing landing page (hero, features, how it works, CTA)
- Pricing page (Free / Pro / Enterprise tiers)
- Authentication (Clerk sign-in/sign-up, middleware protection)
- User dashboard (server-side, Prisma queries)
- Simulation catalog page
- Simulation detail page (with launch/coming soon per module)
- Results/scorecard page (multi-axis bars, grade, debrief, platform badge)
- **Game Engine Integration API** (4 endpoints for session, events, completion)
- **Platform Analytics API** (session analytics + debrief endpoints)
- **API Key authentication** (SHA-256 hashed, separate from Clerk)
- Database schema (10 models, 10 enums — GameEvent, ApiKey added; DecisionNode, NodeOption, SessionDecision removed)
- Docker deployment (multi-stage build, standalone output)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions: lint → build → deploy)
- Live at simvado.com (3 containers: app, postgres, redis)
- Webhooks configured (Clerk + Stripe)

### What's Next

| Priority | Task |
|----------|------|
| **High** | Run Prisma migrations on production database |
| **High** | Build Module 1 in Unreal Engine |
| **High** | Integrate Unreal build with Simvado Game Engine API |
| **Medium** | Set up Cloudflare R2 for media storage |
| **Medium** | Build CMS for simulation content management |
| **Medium** | Set up www.simvado.com DNS |
| **Low** | Add Vitest unit tests |
| **Low** | Add Playwright E2E tests |

### Known Technical Decisions

1. **Lazy Stripe init** — Stripe client uses getter function to avoid build-time crashes with empty keys
2. **Conditional ClerkProvider** — Root layout wraps with ClerkProvider only when valid key present
3. **force-dynamic on app layout** — Prevents SSG issues with Clerk components
4. **Variable rename** — `module` renamed to `simModule` in API routes to avoid Next.js ESLint conflict
5. **Dual auth** — Clerk JWT for platform users, API keys for game engines (game API routes excluded from Clerk middleware)
6. **Stripe API version** — Pinned to `2025-02-24.acacia` for SDK compatibility
